excerpt: This project migrates the datasets from Google Cloud Storage (GCS) to BigQuery. The <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/pamap2+physical+activity+monitoring">Physical Activity Monitoring Dataset</a> contains 1 data file per subject per session (protocol or optional). The session Protocol contains 9 data files, while Optional has 5 data files. The goal of the pipeline is to merge all the data files into their respective sessions as a table in BigQuery.
